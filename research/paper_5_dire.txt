Abstract:
Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual synthesis, but have also raised concerns about potential abuse for malicious purposes. In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/DIRE.

Key Idea:
Use a pre-trained diffusion model to reconstruct the input image.
Calculate the error (DIRE) between the input image and the reconstructed image.
Diffusion-generated images have low reconstruction error.
Real images have high reconstruction error.

Methodology (inferred from abstract and typical diffusion behavior):
1. Input image x.
2. Add noise to x to get x_t (at some timestep t).
3. Denoise x_t using the pre-trained diffusion model to get x_rec (reconstructed).
4. Compute error = |x - x_rec|.
5. Use this error map or a summary statistic as a feature for classification.
