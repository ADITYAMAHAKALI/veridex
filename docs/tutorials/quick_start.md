# Quick Start (5 min)

This guide will get you up and running with Veridex in under 5 minutes.

## Installation

Veridex is modular. You can install the core library, or include dependencies for specific modalities (text, image, audio, video).

### Core Installation
```bash
pip install veridex
```

### With Modal Dependencies
```bash
pip install "veridex[text]"    # For advanced text signals (transformers)
pip install "veridex[image]"   # For image signals (diffusers, torch)
pip install "veridex[all]"     # Install everything
```

## Text Detection Example

Here's how to check if a text is generated by AI using the `PerplexitySignal`. This signal analyzes the complexity of the text; AI models often produce "lower perplexity" (more predictable) text than humans.

```python
from veridex.text import PerplexitySignal

# Initialize the signal
# (No arguments needed for default heuristic mode)
signal = PerplexitySignal()

# Analyze text
text = "This is a sample text to analyze. AI often writes very predictable sentences."
result = signal.detect(text)

# Print the result
print(f"AI Probability Score: {result.score:.4f}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.4f}")
print(f"Metadata: {result.metadata}")
```

## Image Detection Example

For image detection, you can use signals like `DIRESignal` (Diffusion Reconstruction Error) or `CLIPSignal`. Note that these require heavy dependencies (`veridex[image]`).

```python
from veridex.image import DIRESignal

# Initialize the signal (will verify if torch/diffusers are installed)
try:
    signal = DIRESignal()
    
    # Path to an image file
    image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
    
    result = signal.detect(image_path)
    
    if result.error:
        print(f"Error: {result.error}")
    else:
        print(f"AI Probability Score: {result.score:.4f}")
        print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.4f}")

except ImportError:
    print("Please install image dependencies: pip install veridex[image]")
```

## Understanding the Result

All signals return a `DetectionResult` object with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `score` | `float` | Probability that the content is **AI-generated**. Range `[0.0, 1.0]`. <br> `0.0` = Human, `1.0` = AI. |
| `confidence` | `float` | How reliable the signal considers this specific assessment. Range `[0.0, 1.0]`. |
| `metadata` | `dict` | Signal-specific metrics (e.g., perplexity values, entropy scores) for debugging or advanced logic. |
| `error` | `str` | If present, the detection failed. Check this field before trusting the score. |
